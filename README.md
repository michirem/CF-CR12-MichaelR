# CF-CR12-MichaelR

For this CodeReview, the following criteria were graded:
- make a CRUD (create/read/update/delete) for the offers
- create a details file, when you click on any offer it will lead you to a page that will show more info about the offer that you clicked on.
- in the details page, you need to use google map API to locate the location of the offer (remember that your database should have the columns longitude and latitude)
- use the jokes API to show a joke in the navbar every time the page is loaded. There should be a button that when clicked will show another joke (AJAX must be used for this task)

**Bonus points:**

- From the database that was built, create an API that will return details (i.e.: location name and price ) from all offers from your agency.
